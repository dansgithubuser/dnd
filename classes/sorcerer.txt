-----Draconic Bloodline-----
You know the draconic language.

If you are proficient in some cha skill and use it while interacting with dragons, you are considered expert.

You have draconic resilience: your max hp increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. As well, if you are not wearing armor, your AC is 13 + dex modifier.

-----Wild Magic-----
You are prone to wild magic surges: from time to time the DM will inform you of random magical effects you accidentally loose.

Tides of Chaos: You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
