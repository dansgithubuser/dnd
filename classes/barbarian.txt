=====Rage=====
You can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
- advantage on str checks and str saving throws
- +2 to str modifier for melee weapon damage
- resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage as a Bonus Action.

After raging twice, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

=====Unarmored Defense=====
While you are not wearing any armor, your AC is 10 + dex modifier + con modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
