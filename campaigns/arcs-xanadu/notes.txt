I wanted to start a group at work. There's likeminded people and we're already often in the same spot at the same time.
I figured it'd be best to start with a series of one-shots to see what the group liked, before committing to something longer.
I had found that in lighter games like Honey Heist, it was easy to make strong character choices in the game, like sacrificing yourself or betraying the party.
So I wondered about a one-shot where the character is completed with the _completion_ of their arc held in mind, and the goal to make it happen in the single session.
As a twist, the DM would attempt to make all character completion arcs become fulfilled in the same moment (at the climax of the session).
Additionally, the DM can play with prophecy because they uniquely know how each character will complete their arc.

We created characters together to encourage strong connections between the characters.
I want each character to feel connected to the plot, but I find it tiresome to play that justification as session 1.
Rather, seems to fit better out-of-character at session 0.
