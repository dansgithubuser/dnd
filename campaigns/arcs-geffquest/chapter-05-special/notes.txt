halloween special
doomsday scenario
flashback to at least one ancestor of present party
	marcus's ancestor
		and brother?
with relevance to current party that is revealed to players while playing

inspirations:
	the setup of Game of Thrones Battle of Winterfell (where Arya kills the Night King)
		whatever happens at the table is probably gonna be a better ending
	more from Freespace... the present campaign should be after Capella goes supernova
		how can a star go supernova but earth is still around?
			swap star systems for planes, so capella can be not (our) sol
			(our) earth was cut off from the planar union when lucifer-equivalent was defeated
			flashback isn't on (our) earth
				hope to get back?
	a divination wizard turned necromancer (night king equivalent)
		died and self-resurrected
		while dead, saw the fate coming for everyone, and decides killing everyone normally is the compassionate thing to do

concrete idea:
	backstory-of-flashback
		marcus's ancestor is part of some planar union effort to do damage control on a Destroyer scout
			the wizards have fallen
				the couldn't think beyond the wish spell
				a cleric figures that magic cannot be used directly
			they lure it into the link between planes
			they sacrifice the link between planes to defeat it
			marcus's ancestor is orphaned from his family on (our) earth
	14 years later
	hook:
		The Fallen Prophet, Ex, continues his southward conquest and is soon to arrive at Castle Tellus.
		Following the delusions of his death-vision, he has amassed undead equaling the forces allied to protect the castle.
		However, the successor prophet Tensa and your clear minds can shift the battle to come in your favor.
		You and the other heroes of the realm must create and execute a plan to weather the seige and defeat Ex.
	necroprophet stuff happens, gameplay
		necroprophet describes enough of what's coming that marcus's ancestor figures there might be a way to get back
		necroprophet casts a spell that ensures everyone in the area will find their way to the leylines upon death
	epilog:
		marcus's ancestor opens the gate back home
		instead of going anywhere, destroyers come through and blot out the sun, charm marcus's ancestor, teleport him out (to watch & suffocate), then turn the sun into a black hole
		OR
		marcus's ancestor doesn't open the gate back home
		upon death, enters the leylines and feels the presence of his family

justifications/notes:
	the link between planes served as the plane-tuned component of the plane shift spell
		it when unlinked, it and everything inside stops existing
	destroyers are invulnerable, including to the wish spell
		destroyers are vulnerable where magic is used to harness nature
			for example, using magic to unlink the link between planes causes it to nullify itself and its contents
	shortly after the supernova, destroyers go to our earth and end the 13th common era
	the supernova allows the destroyers to link the link between planes to their network
