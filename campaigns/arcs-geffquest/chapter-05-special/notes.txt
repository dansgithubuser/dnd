halloween special
doomsday scenario
flashback to at least one ancestor of present party
	marcus's ancestor
(secret) with relevance to current party

inspirations:
	the setup of Game of Thrones Battle of Winterfell (where Arya kills the Night King)
		whatever happens at the table is probably gonna be a better ending
	more from Freespace... the present campaign should be after Capella goes supernova
		how can a star go supernova but earth is still around?
			swap star systems for planes, so capella can be not (our) sol
			(our) earth was cut off from the planar union when lucifer-equivalent was defeated
			flashback isn't on (our) earth
				hope to get back?
	a divination wizard turned necromancer (night king equivalent)
		died and self-resurrected
		while dead, saw the fate coming for everyone, and decides killing everyone normally is the compassionate thing to do

concrete idea:
	backstory-of-flashback
		marcus's ancestor is part of some planar union effort to defeat a Destroyer scout
			they sacrifice the link between planes to defeat it
			marcus's ancestor is orphaned from his family on (our) earth
	14 years later
	necroprophet stuff happens, gameplay
		necroprophet describes enough of what's coming that marcus's ancestor figures there might be a way to get back
		necroprophet casts a spell that ensures everyone in the area will find their way to the leylines upon death
	epilog:
		marcus opens the gate back home
		instead of going anywhere, destroyers come through and blot out the sun, charm marcus's ancestor, teleport him out (to watch & suffocate), then supernova the sun

todo: link up with timeline
