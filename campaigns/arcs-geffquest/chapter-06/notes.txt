The half-orc arrives at Oldgarden. Goblins attack, raccoons join.

===== Sigirroeth =====
The lost land Sigirroeth is located south of the Moonshadow tribe. It is most easily found via the undergrounds, which are most well-known as the Lightfoot tunnels and the Moonshadow caves. Traveling south in the Moonshadow caves leads to a flooded tunnel that has been treated as a dead end. Sigirroeth naturally flooded 5k years ago. No elves were hurt. However, the legend of the "Sigirroeth Sickness" tells of a group of elves who missed Sigirroeth. They set up new homes on the shore nearest Sigirroeth and one day they simply disappeared.

The group of elves had managed to breed a species of seaweed they could construct bubbles of air and tunnels out of. Once they had that worked out, they simply moved back to Sigirroeth. Over time their bodies adapted further to underwater life, but still required air. They constructed clay golems to build larger underwater structures.

188 years later, the underwater society was found by an aboleth. The aboleth trapped and infected an elf, who spread the infection to the others. The population declined and the settlement fell into disrepair.

The aboleth came from a settlement further south, down a sinkhole. The aboleths are staying in hiding until after the return of the destroyers. They prepare for such a day and their return to glory.
