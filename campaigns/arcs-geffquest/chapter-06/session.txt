Effy has vision.

Elbus the half-orc arrives, goblins attack, raccoons attack from a bush. After the goblins are dealt with, Erenn tracks the bush and finds magic raccoons. He speaks with them. He heads back when he realizes he can't dispel them of magic without them retaliating. The party regroups at the tavern. They recall the apothecary the raccoons drank all the potions in, and the single raccoon that drank too much and was left immobilized in the apothecary. Erenn translates for Geff, hoping for Geff's charisma to shine through. However, the raccoon slips up and feels he said too much, and casts banishment on Geff, which fails. They dispel the raccoon and roll him out. They wait for the other raccoons to show up. The raccoons do not reveal themselves, but they do cast fly on the big raccoon, who flies away.

In Sigirroeth, the party meets Sloop, Shmurple, Shmurple, Shmurple, Lars, Bars, Scars, and Mars. Sloop is weird and the others are nonverbal. Erenn sees a grey clouding in their eyes and figures something is wrong. They collect treasure, particularly a force cube, and use it to defeat the clay golem from safety. They claim the treasure in the temple the golem was in.
