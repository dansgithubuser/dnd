The egg at oldgarden dies of natural causes. The cultists leave.

===== 12945 years ago =====
"The Destroyers" decimate the planet.
Eggs are put in caves near leylines intersections to incubate. The eggs are too big to be dragon eggs, but otherwise look similar. Cultists are charmed and installed at each egg site.
A backup safehouse is established on the moon. Eggs are to be transferred there if something goes wrong.

An egg is placed where Oldgarden will eventually be.

Cralravian is beheaded, to be eaten. However, his body keeps moving and retaliates, acting on deep survival instinct, blindly. He scratches a destroyer's eye. The destroyer is so impressed, it gives Cralravian a "prosthetic" head. Cralravian is told what happened, this in binding words "no one will believe you". Then he is left alone.

A global spell erases memories of the destroyers. The extinction is rationalized as a magical catastrophe. Meaning this is the start of the 14th common era.
