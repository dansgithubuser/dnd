ezideeth has fled to the north, following the south side of the river heading northwest from cranberry
	he convinced himself that ethotheel was the werewolf
	but the werewolf was bees
	and there's adventurers about
	he admits what he did and accepts self-exile
if the party can't figure out how to find ezideeth, the forest will guide them with a spirit wolf

===== reward for helping elves =====
- the magic here is layered. there are truths and lies in truths and lies
	- for the non-elves: always look for the deeper truth
	- for the non-elves: when you catch a lie, what new conclusion did you make? who wants you to think it?
- the forest indicates a secret pain deep in the earth, meant for you
