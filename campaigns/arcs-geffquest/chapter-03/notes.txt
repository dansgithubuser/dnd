===== reward for helping elves =====
- the magic here is layered. there are truths and lies in truths and lies
	- for the non-elves: always look for the deeper truth
	- for the non-elves: when you catch a lie, what new conclusion did you make? who wants you to think it?
- the forest indicates a secret pain deep in the earth, meant for you
