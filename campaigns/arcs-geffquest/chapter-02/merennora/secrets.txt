===== forest fire =====
solve: 2 trust

a year ago, there was a forest fire on the border of bowyer and lightfoot territory
foul play suspected because of the overall shape of the fire
despite it being dry season, based on the wind direction (NW), the start point of the fire doesn't make sense
bowyers suspect

cause: twin half-elf kids, age 15
mother: Ivisthith Jumell Lightfoot 4291
half-elves aren't kept in the lineage
kids started a forest fire while playing with fire
	got a magnifying glass from moonshadow
	something they charred started burning after they left it, thinking they'd failed
		they did knowingly succeed elsewhere later
