=====Elf=====
You don't work in a toy factory or serve humans -- you're a proper elf. You love things like plants, animals, complex etiquette, and being xenophobic. You're pretty androgynous to most other races. You'll engage anyone in a political debate, likely arguing for some typical elven brand of anarchy that you're convinced is unique and works really well.
