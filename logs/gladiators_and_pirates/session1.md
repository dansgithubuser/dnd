Mithax the male dragonborn fighter, Benetoct Fenzene the ranger, and Katerina Eggins the spicy sorceress have recovered after partying after a successful show at the colosseum in Mars. They converse on the ferry back to Banting, where they live. Mars is a ghost town, except for a few hermits, when a show or the celebration after isn't on. Benetoct, who commutes from the capital Emilis, boasts that he defended the convoy his carriage was in from goblins that descended from the forest near Banting, before arriving at the show. He claims they had big lizards like a human might have a dog, and that one bit him. He shows a big green bite mark as evidence.

When they arrive, they immediately head toward the Spider's Cauldron, the best tavern in Banting, for some whiskey, moonshine, and young meat. Benetoct treats his green wound with the whiskey topically as well as orally. Katerina finds a muscular bald man with grey skin to hit on, but is turned off with his stiff mannerism. Mithax tries to pick a fight with him, but the man is too dense to understand. Mithas then finds the oldest person in the tavern, a woman with a purple flower on her black hat and a pheasant feature sticking out of the pocket of her red robes, and talks to her. She introduces herself as Ingrid. He learns of a time when she was a girl and all the kids found something underground that all the adults hid from them. Mithas asks where that happened and she says out in old Jesperson's farm. Mithax asks for her to take her there tomorrow morning and she obliges.

Katerina has overheard this exchange, having followed Mithax since he was talking to the grey person. When the three regroup, she suggests going to Jesperson's farm that night -- no point in dillydallying. When they get to the farm they split up to cover more territory but are interrupted by a lightning strike out of nowhere. Wind picks up. They regroup and see a purple light to the east. They move toward it and establish that it is coming from the water. They hear a yell of "help!" from where they came from and go back. They locate Royston Flynn, and he exclaims there are hooded figures messing up his cabbages. Royston heads toward the town hall to have the general alarm raised. The trio take a gander at the hooded figure. There are four keeping watch and ten digging a small quarry structure. They hear the general alarm being raised. It is protocol to check in, but they count on Royston to account for them, and head for the purple light again. At the shore they establish that the purple light is coming from a ship.

They commandeer a dragonboat and head toward the ship. When they near it, arrows strike toward them but only impact water. They back off. They hatch a plan to go upwind of the ship so that arrows will be harder to aim. Just as they near their goal, a big wave causes Mithax to tumble out of the boat. This gives Katerina an idea to approach the ship as if they were drowned. They get to the ship with no further problems. Mithax throws a grappling hook up and Benetoct climbs. He spots four hooded figures on the ship: one steering, two standing guard, and one in the crow's nest. He starts tying himself so he can shoot an arrow without giving himself up, but Katerina gets impatient and climbs up. Once she's up, Benetoct hops properly aboard, and Mithax follows shortly after, making sure to tie the rope to the boat.

Mithax runs one skeleton overboard with his pike; Katerina burns one with her firebolts; Benetoct has trouble connecting his arrows in the wind, and with the ship listing. Mithax takes another down, and the final one runs below deck but he catches up and ends it with a single strike.

They proceeed down the same door and come to another, which they open, surprising a mess hall of skeletons drinking ale. Katerina flings a vial of alchemist's fire but it bounces off one a skull and lands on the table unbroken. Benetoct shoots it with an arrow, setting the mess hall aflame. The trio retreats back, and continues down the staircase. They come to a stone door that Mithax cannot break. Mithax listens for what's on the other side. He hears voices calling for him. Katerina hears a single seductive voice. Benetoct hears his mom calling him for lunch. They are all motivated to get through the door, but cannot break it down. They head back up, through the smoke. Katerina trips but manages to catch some air near the ground and continue the way up, where Mithax and Benetoct wait. The door next to the first starts emitting smoke, so they check out the other two at the front of the ship. Below one is a map room; they quickly dispatch a skeleton and take all the maps they can find -- seven in total. The ship starts sinking. The second door leads to a potions room. Katerina takes three potions; Benetoct takes a spyglass; Mithax takes a spiky bow he recognizes as dragonborn. They jump off the ship toward their boat. While still in the air, they are blinded by a purple light. They plunge into the water, surface and see the ship is missing. They and their boat are sucked toward where it was as the moment-ago-displaced water fills in. They get in their dragonboat and return home.

There they check in on Royston's farm. The hooded figures are gone, but the quarry they dug is not. They descend to an ancient dwarven tunnel. To the east is a chamber with a recently opened chest; further east the tunnel has caved in. The tunnel continues west beyond sight. Mithax takes the chest back up.

They confront Royston and think he might be a skeleton, so Mithax puts him in the chest. They sleep.

Old Jesperson, Royston's neighbor, wakes them just before noon. He is surprised when Katerina is at the door, but given the night's events, isn't too suspicious. After Jesperson leaves, the trio lets Royston out of the chest. He gets finds some water and runs out. The trio take a look at their loot. Katerina identifies one of her potions as a magical acid. They identify one of their maps as of the local area and see a dwarven establishment below the Tridelhorn, and an elven establishment in the forest near Banting. The spiky bow and the spyglass they know they must go to Emilis to identify.

Benetoct goes to the library, where his mother Maryam is head librarian. She nags him for seeking danger, but sends him to Sister Gabriel, the head geographer to help identify the maps. Four she identifies as maps of the greater Emilis area. Two she asks to have more time with to identify.

Katerina goes to the apothecary, who identifies the two remaining potions: one of water breathing, and one that will cause electricity to jump from the cork to the splashed area.

Mithax explores further down the western leg of the dwarven tunnel. After walking for twenty minutes, he steps on a pressure plate. Carefully, he looks around and finds hidden doors on either side of him. He keeps the plate depressed with his pike and backs away, then lets go. A mechanism clunks but nothing else happens. He breaks down the door on the right, and a fire erupts from a vent at the end of small chamber beyond. The fire corporealizes into a central sphere and two orbiting. It slowly moves toward him. He backs off, finding an identical chamber and flame behind him. He runs back where he came from. When he reaches a certain distance, the flames head back to their vents at the same steady pace, rather than chasing him. He steps back within the distance and the flames come toward him again. He uses his spear to stab one before it can get to him. No effect. He disengages and heads back out.
