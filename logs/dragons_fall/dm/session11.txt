Chapter 11 - Forgefire

Following their map deep into the dangerous mesh of Razorgrass, the adventurers discovered the remains of an ancient ruined town. The once vibrant city had been abandoned during the Draconic apocalypse, and all of its inhabitants had fled hastily with what little they could carry.  Though stalked by sand sharks, they managed to enter the city via the spire of an old armory, and descended deep into the depths of an ancient tinkerer's laboratory. A thorough search on the ground floor found no gauntlets, but a small set of automated magical appraiser's tools, along with a glowing forge hammer, green with magics.

Old dwarven magic laid here, the entire basement itself was a forge, powered by old dwarven magic yet unrefined by time or expertise. The walls and pillars were rough hewn and crude, with no decorations or embellishments. The floor was simple iron or stone, with jagged edges that radiated age and primal origins. At the back of the long forge the found the master armory, five tall pillars holding items of great renown...or least they did... Time and thievery had taken its toll one two of the pillars, their platforms barren. However three items still remained, a full helm with a visor, a tall tower shield, and the gauntlets.



Before them stood the forge guard, an enormous automaton armed with a spear and shield, while behind the pillars stool the forge master, equally created but with a workbench and tools to match. They stood 15 feet tall, carefully watching the adventurers. On either side, several rough large levers controlled the temperature of  the room, from blazing hot, to frigid cold. Through clever manipulation and a little luck, the adventurers managed to escape with all three of the items, while the automatons remained (more or less) intact.

However, during the melee, Belle dropped the helmet upon Keanu's head. When the adventurers escaped from the forge and settled to rest, Keanu found he could not remove the helmet...
