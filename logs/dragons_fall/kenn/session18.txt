	some magic types talking about magical laylines that defend planes from outsiders, weakened here

	another teleportation circle, smaller, inactive
	a cave that connects to outside?
	outside: a mountain in the middle of the ocean, the northeast end of the shattered peaks
		at peak, there is a spent manastone spike
		lies at intersection of two magical laylines

retcon: we learned of 8 ritual sites from talking with dead, not from cats (who did not find them all)

trial of quartermaster
	trial by combat vs keanu
	fallen paladin
	patron is the same one kenn dreamt of, opposed to his own
	keanu wins singlehanded
indrix talking to venova through robert the robot
	nations are turtling up in prep for coming of evil
		no comms w mothros
	there are 4 more magical layline intersections
	kehaka might be a cultist
