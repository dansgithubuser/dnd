What happened:
- in manastone chamber inside temple in underwater city
- didn't realize the chamber would be big
- or have any company...
- psychic connection with kraken inside, another warlock chosen by my patron
- gives me 3 choices:
	- give life to him
	- receive life from him
	- neither (chose this)
- drilling hole in manastone to put magic bean in, harpooned away before hole could be completed
- kraken killed
- cultists (including red dragonborn) leave

Kenn is currently unconscious but if he wakes:
- looking for manastone to continue drilling hole
- when realizes kraken dead, assumes world is ending soon
- frustrated with party for not protecting him to let him get the hole done
- wants to talk to patron
- wants to sleep before doing anything rash

If patron doesn't give a deus ex machina:
- loses hope, even after sleeping on it
	- the Yetis hurting his friend Robert made Kenn doubt battle altogether
	- the monks who likely fell to the Redscapes solidified that battle is random and uncaring
	- this defeat convinces him that battle _cannot_ be relied upon
	- but he doesn't recognize there is a path outside battle yet, feels like nothing can be relied upon
- leaves party to head toward mermaid friend, wants to see her home now that he can breathe underwater

After another day:
- perhaps the patron had a reason to show him the failure of the kraken and his party
- figures part of the reason he has been chosen is because he has free will that the patron doesn't (else the patron would just fix this)
- therefore he must come to some conclusion about what happened and find the correct path forward
- the battle path is _not_ his path forward
- level up: gain _planeshift_
- heads toward the black dragon to become a lich, reasoning that if he's dead when the big bad arrives, he will not be consumed
- assumes name "The Echohawk" -- Kenn is dead until the big bad is thwarted
- seeks to explore planes and amass tools and allies
- seeks to augment his brother and party on the battle path -- believes both are necessary -- and his sister has a role to play too
	- communicates w party via hawk familiar
	- Chiara is the legacy?


player-wise:
- having patron being opposed to big bad was a bold choice (and not mine!)
- Kenn knows too much and cares too much about the endgame plot to be a party member
	- there's no time to "smell the roses" (ie investigate a situation and solve it as a team), Kenn always knows the next step
		- admittedly fun for me to be translating the lore into action

narrative thoughts:
- must justify the defeat in-world
	- it is not an interesting story based on what we know so far, must stick the landing
	- we don't tell uninteresting stories
- there _must_ be character ramifications
	- we are not psychopaths who kill stuff for fun and don't care that the world is ending -- this is a terrifying and demoralizing defeat
		- even if the mechanics we tend to play with most often are combat -- we don't do unjustified combat
- this should be the lowest low of the campaign, we don't have anywhere further to go other than dying
	- assuming that there is further complication to bringing in the big bad
		- either need to do ritual w final manastone, or
		- the manastone stuff is complete, but something else needs to happen
		- big bad coming in and _not_ ending the world would be a let-down
		- would be cool if the last sacrifice must be a warrior with Echohawk blood (Karen Echohawk ended up in a manastone, right?)
			- allows party to pick its own timing
- aside: is the sunken island gonna float up now?

dm feedback:
- need to focus on making a fun game, not a challenging one
	- example: expending a spell slot _is_ a setback
