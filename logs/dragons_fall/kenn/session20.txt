tiefling ship
sent robot down to fetch wood from other sunken ships
	came back safely with some wood
		use dry wood to dry wet wood, enough fuel for night
boat rights itself during the night

	help monks after awkward thaumaturgy convo through Belle
	snipe a captain until he fleas into the ship, fly over w robot and drop bean
	eldritch blast a manastone cannonball, destroying poop deck
	can't find captain
