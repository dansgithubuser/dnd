<h3>Divine Sense</h3>
As an action, you can activate your divine sense. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your cha modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.
<h3>Lay on Hands</h3>
Your blessed touch can heal woun ds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long
rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5. As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use, expending hit points separately
for each one. This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
