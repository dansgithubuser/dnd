<h3>The Archfey</h3>
spells: faerie fire, sleep
fey presence: As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a wis saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h3>The Fiend</h3>
spells: burning hands, command
dark one's blessing: when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, you gain temporary hit points equal to your cha modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).
<h3>The Great Old One</h3>
spells: dissonant whispers, Tasha's hideous laughter
awakened mind: You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You donâ€™t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.
