The game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) cycles through the following phases:
1) The Dungeon Master (DM) describes the environment
2) Players describe how their characters respond

These two steps feed into each other, of course: characters respond to the environment, and the environment is modified by the characters. When players describe what their characters do, they typically do not have complete information about the world, and so can only speak in intent. The DM must resolve their intent into action. One way to go about about this, is to allow the DM to interrupt a player exactly when the player commits to an action that they don't know the outcome of. The DM then figures how the action resolves. In some cases, the DM already knows the answer and can just narrate. However, a good game mechanic and creator of player agency, is to have the DM strive to come up with multiple outcomes for each action, as well as associated difficulties. The player rolls a d20 and the associated outcome results. These outcomes should truly be different. One way to ensure this is at the extremes: for example, a roll of 20 should offer as much as the player desires and possibly more, and a 1 should add more challenge to the situation than the DM originally planned. The DM should not seek perfection in these judgments. As long as there is no underlying bias, simply having many checks over time should make for a fair and engaging game. If there is a bias, the group should rely on their out-of-game negotiation to express and resolve it. A DM should have fun if and only if the players are having fun.

When a d20 is rolled, the player should know what skill it is being associated to. Picking this skill should be a negotiation between the player and the DM. For example, if the DM asks for a deception check, but the player thinks they are being honest, they might ask for a persuasion check.

Both the DM and the players should see themselves as writers of the world. Only the characters actually live in it. So new information doesn't always have to pertain to something new. For example, filling in backstory as you go -- as the result of certain ability checks even -- so long as it doesn't conflict with the established world, allows one to start a game with less up-front burden, and allows the detail of the world to grow indefinitely over time.

Players play characters, but they are not characters. For example, a smart person playing an unintelligent character may come up with many interesting solutions through a game. Depending on the table, a DM might need to step in to adjust. If table is especially committed to their characters, instead of a more casual experience, the player might appreciate being reminded they are falling out of character. Or maybe the player doesn't actually enjoy a dim character and the character needs some adjustment.

In general, as a player, when you receive information about the world, you should figure out how your character would interpret that information, and only share that. If you find this makes you holding back many ideas that are interesting to you, try to negotiate with the DM a character adjustment that would help you have more fun.

No player can perfectly separate their knowledge from their characters. So, players should seek to maintain the asymmetry of information between themselves and the DM, as well as each other. Not in things that they would rationally willingly share, but having this asymmetry deepens character and allows nuanced interactions. For example, if the DM sends you a piece of information, be it on your character sheet, a private note, a text message, or anything else, you should seek to understand the information alone. For example, do not, as the player, read out loud a note that the DM has given you. It makes it too obvious that you're regurgitated something that the DM told you. If the DM wanted the table to know the information absolutely, they wouldn't have sent it in a private format. You may still want to offer the information, but you must allow the players to doubt what you're saying is truthful.
<h2>Combat</h2>
In some situations, the DM requires fine-grained control over time, and the players should understand the structure so as to properly convey their characters. Usually this happens in a combat situation and is so named. A round of combat lasts about 6 seconds. Players roll initiative to find out what order they takes turns in a round. The DM also rolls initiative for all non-players in the combat. All action in a round happens simultaneously, and the DM solidly defines how the round resolves and guides the players on what information their characters have when taking their turn.

When taking a turn, players state their intent. The DM will resolve their intent into the following structure:
- movement
- an Action
- a Bonus Action
- free actions

While the DM is ultimately accountable for the consistency of the world, the better each player understands this structure, the easier it will be for them to convey their intent to the DM. Conversely, players should not leave their intent unspoken if they don't know how to phrase it in this structure.
<h2>Starting At Level 0</h2>
Classes in D&D have a lot of detail, even at level 1. This helps differentiate characters, but it can be a lot for a new player. Starting at level 0, that is, starting without a class, allows players to get a feel for the game without burdening them with a lot of rules. In time, characters will develop and players will familiarize with the rules, and a class can be picked.

Magic-users are particularly constrained by being classless, so assign them a class and give them their cantrips. For more complicated magical solutions, be lenient and allow skill checks to determine the outcome. This flavor of magic works even after the character levels up.

A full character sheet can be distracting if you're starting at level 0. The key features are:
- ability scores: str, dex, con, int, wis, cha
- physicality: race, age, height, weight, eye color, skin color, hair color
- mentality: background, proficiencies, and languages
- items
- specific magical abilities, if applicable
