Roleplaying your character will be more interesting if they develop throughout the adventure. Your DM should help set up situations in which your character can develop, so you should express your vision to your DM.

It is easy to fall into a pattern of playing a character like yourself. This is not wrong, but you're more likely to develop outside of a game than in. We still want a connection between player and character, but how can we create leverage so that a small amount of insight in the player translates to a transformative experience for the character?

The idea is to pick a topic the player is interested to introspect on, and then build a character that exaggerates the topic. For example, a player might wonder if they are too risk avoidant, and create a character who is extremely risk avoidant, but is thrust into an epic battle. It is important to avoid topics the player is truly insecure about -- the table shouldn't feel like an intervention.

A list of topics follows, to be mixed and matched to help a player find something they're interested in.
