===== TRIGGERS =====
When party arrives where dead deity should be:
- There is a gigantic humanoid-shaped void in the rock.
	- This is unexpected. The deity should be here.
- Where the humanoid's heart would be, there is an invisible teleportation sphere.
	- Whatever this is, it looks like an invitation.
	- Could be the work of a radical deity.

When the party goes through the teleportation sphere:
- They arrive in a different plane.
- Island with central peak, waterfall, greenery
- Sun above central peak.
- Above looks like sky.
- Horizon and below looks like space.
	- If you fall off the island, you teleport back to where you fell off.
- If you die, you regain full health, slots, etc..
- Planar travel is blocked.

If the party gets the attention of the sun:
- The sun opens, revealing an eye.
- Minions pour out of the eye like tears.

If the party sneaks into the sun:
- They get a surprise round.
- All the minions are in a bunch.

If the party deconcepts the sun:
- They appear back in the humanoid-shaped void, and the teleportation sphere is gone.
- Ultracleaner should be applied to a pile of ash that has appeared at the bottom of the humanoid-shaped void.

===== DETAILS =====
----- radical deity -----
A deity that is known, but has no worshipers, is in a state of limbo. Given enough time, they can become a "radical deity", which does not obey the Central Dogma. Instead, the deity obeys some unknowable ideals. All beings that enjoy order, including those who prey on it -- i.e. all entities that are not radical deities -- benefit from the deconception of any radical deity. Multi has a standing "deconcept on sight" order for radical deities, but it hasn't yet come into play. Deconception is always planned in advance.

===== TODO =====
- island encounter & map
