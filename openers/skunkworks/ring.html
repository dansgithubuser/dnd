    <h1>Ring of Unknowing</h1>
    <p>
      This glass ring protects the attuned wearer from concepts. The wearer may designate any number of allies to also receive protection. When the designation happens, the wearer and allies must be in a 5 ft cube. The designation is effective until the wearer chooses another designation, or attunement is lost. If the wearer and designee are in different planes, the designee is not protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protection from concepts is useful when dealing with a dead deity. Even the most principled grandmaster adventurer has stray thoughts. It only takes a single conception of wielding a dead diety's power for a Shock to occur. Rather than relying on the mind, this ring safeguards against such outcomes.

    <p>
      In addition, the ring can cast enchantment spells, so long as they are used negatively. For example destruction, subtraction, or removal. The ring has:
      <ul>
        <li>one 9th-level slot</li>
        <li>one 5th-level slot</li>
        <li>one 3rd-level slot</li>
        <li>one 1st-level slot</li>
      </ul>
      It regains these slots at the dawn of each day.
