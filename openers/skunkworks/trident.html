    <h1>Trident of Planar Subtleties</h1>
    <p>
      This smooth blue trident is a magic weapon. Its teeth binds concepts and forces them into planarly coherence. Embedded in the tail end is a smooth red gemstone that acts as an index node for a Tetrahedron of Planar Subtleties, which partitions a plane so that the partition can be safely destructed. Any deities in that partition will be deconcepted. In higher-dimensional planes, more Tridents are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a critical hit, the trident momentarily splinters the plane inside the body of the target. This appears as a bright white flash that can illuminate bones through flesh. Studies have shown that being exposed to this flash is generally safe for typical usage. Check with your cleric if you feel nauseous.
