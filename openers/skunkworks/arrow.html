    <h1>Arrow of Annihilation</h1>
    <p>
      An Arrow of Annihilation is a convenient way to create a Sphere of Annihilation where it is needed. In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>Two Arrows can be used to create two Spheres in proximity to each other.</li>
        <li>Two Arrows can be used to create two Spheres inside a Tetrahedron of Planar Subtleties.</li>
      </ul>
      When two Spheres are in proximity to each other, they attract, annihilate, and destruct they plane they are in. If this can be done in a Tetrahedon, the arrows can be used to destruct a planar partition. While planar destruction is overkill in most situations, it is a tried and true method of deconcepting a planarly cohered deity.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>+2 to attack</li>
      <li>a Sphere of Annihilation is created where the arrow hits</li>
      <li>on a miss, the arrow returns to sender</li>
    </ul>
