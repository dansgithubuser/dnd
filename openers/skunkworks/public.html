    <h1>Skunkworks</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      You are a member of a grandmaster adventuring party. Most adventurers split up at some point, as each individual gains responsibilities alongside their incredible powers, and are pulled in unique directions. For whatever reason, you've managed to stick together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your party is the skunkworks of the adventuring guild "Multi", one of the most prestigious guilds in the prime material plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Multi's skunkworks, there are two rules:
      <ol>
        <li>Never be discovered.</li>
        <li>Get the job done.</li>
      </ol>
      If Rule 2 is broken, your retirement is graciously accepted. If Rule 1 is broken, a complicated series of contracts holding peace between a large web of dragons, archliches, elderbrains, and the like is starkly demonstrated as void. In this case, the prime material plane will likely be switched off, and you'd do well to have a clear plan of how to ascend to godhood in that instant. Even for you it is simpler to not break this rule.
    </p>
    <h3>Today's Case</h3>
    <p>
      A group of entry-level Multi adventurers are rescuing a couple kids from a goblin hideout in a magical mine. Seven and change centuries ago, the magical mine was operated by dwarves. At the time, Multi humanely wiped out the dwarves with a magical pox. The magical mine is situated above a dead deity. Dead deities are dangerous because of how deities gain their power -- from their worshipers. An unknown deity has no power (hence "dead"). A dead deity gaining a single worshiper is a Shock, wherein the individual can typically project their entire mortal (i.e. myopic) desires onto the full power of a deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last time this file came up, because the dwarves weren't affiliated with Multi, the response was quick and simple, and the problem forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your goal is to deconcept the deity before the goblins, hastened by the adventurers, dig deep enough to discover the deity. The goblins don't know what they are digging, but they know how to aim for purer and purer magical crystal. You are allocated one deconception kit, outlined below. You are expected to plan your tools to get below the goblins' dig without them seeing you. The entry-level Multi adventurers should complete their quest, including facing the goblins, so no vaporizing the goblins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrinkle in all this is that Multi's prophets didn't foresee it. It's not something you're entirely unfamiliar with, given that your own party is unseeable by prophets. But something has to be missing.
    </p>
    <h3>Deconception Kit</h3>
    <p>
      Multi's Research Arm has made huge advances in deconception, making the process easier than ever. The latest set of tools is offered to you:
      <ul>
        <li>One (1) <a href="ring.html">Ring of Unknowing</a> - to be attuned before observing the deity</li>
        <li>Five (5) <a href="trident.html">Trident of Planar Subtleties</a> - four of which must be inserted into the deity in a tetrahedral configuration</li>
        <li>Two (2) <a href="arrow.html">Arrow of Annihilation</a> - which each must be fired at the deity <i>after completing the Tetrahedron of Planar Subtleties</i></li>
        <li>One (1) Infinite Vial of Ultracleaner (Lemon Scent) - ultracleaner should be applied to any gore, goop, dust, etc. left by the results of the previous steps</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Character Creation</h2>
    <p>
      You will create a 20th level character for this adventure.

    </p>
    <p>
      In addition:
      <ul>
        <li>Equip yourself with anything, but give your DM a chance to spot-check. Finding an advantageous glitches in the rules is cool; if you find a way to take infinite turns it's no fun for anyone.</li>
        <li>Take an epic boon.</li>
        <li>If you like, homebrew something for your character. Big choices are more fun than big numbers. A sledgehammer that casts fireball on a critical hit says a lot about the user. A knife that grants +10 to hit is boring and potentially game-breaking. Again, give your DM a chance to spot-check.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>A Little More Background</h2>
    <h3>Do's and Don't's of a Skunkworker</h3>
    Skunkworkers are an eclectic bunch. Over time, Multi has refined a list of Do's and Don't's that should help you know sensible limits for whatever strikes your fancy.
    <ul>
      <li>Do improvise when something unexpected happens</li>
      <li>Don't leave your soul in a locked plane</li>
      <li>Do make prophecies</li>
      <li>Don't prophesize the breaking of Rule 1</li>
      <li>Do use the right equipment for the job</li>
      <li>Don't lose Multi Research Arm products, unless they are fully vaporized</li>
      <li>Do engage in time travel, especially to amend provisional violations of Rule 1</li>
      <li>Don't break the One True Timeline</li>
      <li>Don't worry too much about traps</li>
      <li>Do overcome all obstacles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Miscellany</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Zark Mystralbird is the head of Multi. You've had lunch with him and he doesn't seem like much of an adventurer. Seems like a political role.</li>
      <li>Multi's main rival is the adventuring guild "Numbers".</li>
      <li>Today is February 27th of the year 1070, of the fourth common era.</li>
    </ul>
