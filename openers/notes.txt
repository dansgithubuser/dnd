A Formula for a Successful First Session

1. Greater Setting
You don't need to repeat these steps between sessions.
Build it over time.

1.1 Start with a general fantasy setting
Start building a world that is the intersection of both D&D and LoTR.
You can assume players know this stuff.

1.2 Add headcanon
Build a more detailed greater setting that you like.
Some of this should be conveyed before roleplaying starts to help flesh out the world, and ease into engagement with it.

My own set follows.

On races:
- Humans are most common, followed by dwarves and elves.
- Humans are by far the least racist and most welcoming toward other races.
- Only humans have sexism.
- Half-breeds are infertile.
- Dragonborn come from the desert.
- Tieflings are rare; their parents and children are usually are human.
- Orcs don't have a word for love, and only one word for sex
	- A man's value is judged in part by number of children, double-score for half-humans.
- Goblins have a fast and exponential reproductive cycle, a couple years to maturity, most goblins are twins.
	- They don't value life like other races.
	- Live about 4 years on average; up to 30 in captivity.

On magic:
- There are many planes.
- We inhabit the "prime material plane" -- but the name is arbitrary.
- Planes, concepts, and ultimate deities are synonyms.
- "The Weave" is the interface magicians access to reach into different planes, thus performing magic.
	- Most magicians understand this either intuitively or theoretically, but few both.

1.3 Random Encounters
Accumulate a set of random encounters. For example:
- Dead horses.
- A dragon who loves treasure.
- Goblins!
- Raccoon drank all the potions in the apothecary.
- A teleportation circle.

2. Backstory
Get ideas from the players.
Digest them into a set of in-world situations the players can engage with.
Create a conflict, and a hook for the players to follow to get involved.
Make a public map of the area the conflict is happening in.

3. Plot
Give the hook to the characters and the map to the players.
The characters don't have a map, they just each have knowledge of the area they live in, and that is what the map represents.
The characters are allowed to investigate to understand the conflict and justify a combat.
Sprinkle random encounters into the exploration.

4. Characters
Create characters; one more than the number of players.
Let the players pick characters.
Have each player add one unique public thing to their character.
Have each player add one unique private thing to their character.
Explain skill proficiencies and work out how to roll checks.
Work out their signature attack and how to roll it with them.
Have them describe how they look to each other.

5. Combat
Have stat blocks for each type of creature.
When a combat occurs, have a stat block in initiative order for each creature in the combat.
Have a battle map so you can remember each action taken -- it's no fun when a player has to repeat something they did, or silently accept that you forgot about it.
