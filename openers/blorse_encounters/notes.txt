Blorse Encounters of the 4th Kind

===== Theme Suggestions =====
- Norse mythology (specifically Yormungandr and Fenrir), Mountains, Oceans/Sailing, and finally HAMMER (< take this one however you want)
- We're adventurers in midgard off to find yggdrasil...? But get entirely sidetracked by shenanigans
- I think it would be cool if the characters at one point were able to break the 4th wall, or enter into our world

===== Theme Research =====
- Yormungandr and Fenrir
	- Fenrir
		- child of Loki and Angrboda
		- sibling of Hel and World Serpent (Jormungandr)
		- foretold to kill Odin in Ragnarok
	- Jormungandr
		- big sea serpent
		- lives in the world sea
		- encircles earth (midgard)
		- bites own tail
		- when it releases its tail, Ragnarok will begin
	- Hel
		- presides over underworld (also named Hel)
		- receives a portion of the dead

===== Theme Translation =====
- We're adventurers in midgard off to find yggdrasil...? But get entirely sidetracked by shenanigans
	-> the Worldtree grants access to different planes
	-> is a legend
	-> the adventurers found some hint of its existence and location
		-> snowfall lands in a pattern, displaying a map
- I think it would be cool if the characters at one point were able to break the 4th wall, or enter into our world
	-> this and the previous one make me think of the adventurers walking down an old abandoned mineshaft, and finding a debug room behind a magic door
- Yormungandr and Fenrir
	-> these probably work best as backstory/nations/politics
	-> Fenristan is a big island inhabited by humanoid wolf natives and humans
	-> The Jormungangr are seafaring orcs that make traveling in the ocean difficult
- Mountains
	-> Fenristan has a large mountain range
		-> dwarves in the mountain range
- Oceans/Sailing
	-> We will need some points of interest that are not on Fenristan
	-> New Hel contains an academy particularly known for necromancy
		-> side quest: amateur necromancy
	-> Bunch of smaller unnamed islands with Jormungangr and random goods
		-> a teleportation circle to an ancient abandoned mine with magical hammers
	-> an elf island
	-> a dragon lives on one of the islands
- HAMMER
	-> one of the characters should fight with a hammer
	-> there should be a hammer in the debug room
