The debug room is completely white except for the entrance, which leads back to the abandoned mine, and a 4x3 rectangle opposite the entrance.
The room is a square with 20 ft sides and soft walls that are impossible to see.

The rectangle is the debug console.

When players figure out what the debug console is:
- check if players want to run as if in combat
- each character may make one wish
- when a character makes a 2nd wish, roll to succeed
	- on a fail, players are ejected and room disappears
- characters are not allowed 3rd wishes (same outcome as roll fail)
