The snowfall omen points to an island south southeast of fenristan, about twice as far as Florfinthel.

At the island: orc encounter

A cave entrance leads to an abandoned mine, which connects the Worldtree. The orcs have found the Worldtree and damaged it.

investigation: the orcs have put an illusion to hide the cave entrance
trap: a tripwire releases poisonous gas in the mine. the gas does 1d8 per round and must be manually dissipated.
debug room: right before the worldtree chamber, a passage has a magic door open on its side. The room inside looks completely white, but doesn't shed light beyond the door.
