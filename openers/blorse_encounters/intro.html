    <h1>Blorse Encounters of the 4th Kind</h1>
    <p>

      The Jormungangr are a society of seafaring orcs who inhabit the local seas. They are antagonistic to everyone. Land-based nations in the area have less trade and war than you'd otherwise expect.

      You have never known it to snow in Fenristan, and yet you wake to a fresh layer of snow. The local wizard claims it is a sign and summons adventurers to sail southeast and "fix the tree". He offers 2000 gold up front and promises powerful magical items to be present at the destination. As well, he gives you a scroll of greater restoration to use on the tree, and a scroll of revivify, just in case.
