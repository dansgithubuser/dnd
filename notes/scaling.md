# Scaling
Notes about making a journey match character level.

## Tiers of Play
From the DMG.

The book describes a few things that I won't repeat here:
- spells (described in a different section)
- magic items (depends on the setting)
- fluff

### Local Heroes
Levels 1-4

1st-level characters are heroes, not regular folk that put on armor. As the title implies, they can save the village.

### Heroes of the Realm
Levels 5-10

This section is vague, but suggests a region bigger than the village that the party has involved themselves with.

### Masters of the Realm
Levels 11-16

The fate of a nation or the world may be decided by the outcome of the quests the party undertakes. They make their mark on the world and have reputations. Consequences are explicitly mentioned for the first time, though presumably there were always consequences.

Suggested activities:
- construct fortresses
- found guilds and the like
- take on apprentices or students
- broker peace between nations or lead them into war

### Masters of the World
Levels 17-20

Far-reaching consequences. There's some focus on planeswalking, but that was possible since 13th level.

At 20th level, some kind of ascendance.

## With Great Power Comes Great Responsbility
My own thoughts on what characters should have to do to earn their abilities. Conversely, what players should contribute to the story.

### Always
- A reason to party up.
- Any personal goal.

### Level 5 and up
- A personal bond. To a friend, family member, party member, people, etc.

### Level 9 and up
- A promise. To someone or something of importance. A nation leader, the general public, a secret agent, etc.

### Level 13 and up
- A sacrifice. Being faced with choosing the lesser of two evils, or the prisoner's dilemma. Choosing between themselves, party, friend, family, people, etc.

### Level 17 and up
- An ideal. It should be clearly stateable. A deity might have it in their portfolio. It should come with restrictions. For example, a necromancer may not be allowed in holy places.
